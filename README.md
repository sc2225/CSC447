CSC447 Concepts of Programming Languages
<br>
<h3>Overview (Taken from course syllabus and lecture):</h3>


<p>
 <b>Programming paradigms and styles:</b>

<ul>
<li>functional vs object-oriented </li>
<li>mutability vs immutability</li>
<li>iteration vs recursion</li>
<li>pattern matching vs visitor design pattern</li>
<li>Runtime Storage: lexical and dynamic scope; stack layout; object and vtable layout to support inheritance and dynamic dispatch; nested structures (functions or objects); garbage collection</li>
<li>Static analysis: dynamic vs static type checking; subtyping; parametric polymorphism</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>COURSE APPROACH</h3>
<p>
Hands on: write many programs and experiments <br>
  <b>Scala as main language:</b>
carefully designed multi-paradigm language.
Textbook explains PL concepts in context to
minimize time spent installing PLs <br>
Also bits of: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript...
... Kotlin, Swift, Rust, Scheme, Haskell
chosen as exemplars of concepts
  </p>
<p>
  <h3>Learning Goals</h3></b>
Learn PLs more easily by recognizing concepts
<ul>
  <li>"it has while loops"</li>
  <li>"it has closures" </li>
  <li>"it has list comprehensions"</li>
  <li>"it has dynamic dispatch using vtables"</li>
  <li>"it has mixins"</li>
  <li>Deeper understanding of PL concepts / paradigms</li>
  <li>Impact of PL on program development, modularity, correctness, runtime efficiency, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <h3>Prerequisite Courses</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Data Structures in Java II (CSC403 or CSC301)</li>
<li>Computer Systems I (CSC406 or CSC373)</li>
  </ul>
<b>Prerequisite Skills</b>
<ul>
<li>You must have programmed with Java and C before this course.</li>
<li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) support is unavailable for
many tools, so you should be familiar with use of the command line:
 <ul>
 <li>Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows</li>
<li>a shell on Linux / OS X such as bash or zsh</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
 </p>
  <h3>Assessment</h3>
  <p>
<b>The course grade will be based on:</b>
  <ul>
<li>Homework assignments 20%</li>
<li>Quizzes 15%</li>
<li>Worksheets 5%</li>
<li>Midterm Exam 25%</li>
<li>Final Exam 35%</li>
    <ul>
    <br> 
Worksheets provide guided instruction through simple problems, and
should be completed before homework assignments and quizzes. Worksheet completion is self-reported, but may be audited by asking for a
demonstration of the completed source code / work.
