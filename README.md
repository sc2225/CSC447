CSC447 Concepts of Programming Languages
<br>

<center><h3>Overview (Taken from course syllabus and lecture):</h3></center>
<p>
  <b>Programming paradigms and styles:</b><br>
functional vs object-oriented <br>
mutability vs immutability<br>
iteration vs recursion<br>
pattern matching vs visitor design pattern<br>
Runtime Storage: lexical and dynamic scope; stack layout; object and vtable layout to support inheritance and dynamic dispatch; nested structures (functions or objects); garbage collection<br>
Static analysis: dynamic vs static type checking; subtyping; parametric polymorphism
</p>
<h3>COURSE APPROACH</h3>
<p>
Hands on: write many programs and experiments <br>
  <b>Scala as main language:</b>
carefully designed multi-paradigm language.
Textbook explains PL concepts in context to
minimize time spent installing PLs <br>
Also bits of: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript...
... Kotlin, Swift, Rust, Scheme, Haskell
chosen as exemplars of concepts
  </P>
<p>
  <center><h3>Learning Goals</h3></b></center>
Learn PLs more easily by recognizing concepts
<ul>
  <li>"it has while loops"</li>
  <li>"it has closures" </li>
  <li>"it has list comprehensions"</li>
  <li>"it has dynamic dispatch using vtables"</li>
  <li>"it has mixins"</li>
  <li>Deeper understanding of PL concepts / paradigms</li>
  <li>Impact of PL on program development, modularity, correctness, runtime efficiency, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
